# Libft

The main goal of this project was to make me avoid using already built-in functions and recreate them in order to really understand how all functions work and use those in future projects.

All functions were created according to Norminette rules, as demands 42 Schools.

This library is ***essential*** for all future projects that I will use and it will be present in most of the 42 projects posted in this Github.
